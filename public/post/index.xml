      <description>Overview We already learned that everything in R that exists is an object. You most likely already noted that there are different types of objects: 2, for instance, was a number, but assign was a function.^[In fact, we will learn below that 2 is not really a number, but a vector or length 1. Only in a next step, 2 counts as a &amp;lsquo;number&amp;rsquo;, or, more precisely as a &amp;lsquo;double&amp;rsquo;.] As you might have guessed, there are many more types of objects.</description>
